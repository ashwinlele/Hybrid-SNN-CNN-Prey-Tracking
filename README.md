# Hybrid-SNN-CNN-Prey-Tracking

This directory contains the code for hybrid SNN+CNN prey tracking algorithm. This is built using
PEDRA drone simulator: https://github.com/aqeelanwar/PEDRA
and
V2E: frame to event converter: https://github.com/SensorsINI/v2e.

PEDRA connects python based SNN and CNN modules developed here with Unreal Engine's drone environment with drones initialized within it. The images captures in PEDRA are converted to event streams using v2e (frames to events converter).

Use requirements file to setup the virtual environment. The project is under progress and the files are expected to change as the work progresses.
